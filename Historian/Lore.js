				"Confused I looked around. Spikes on walls. So it did happen. Spikes nearest me\n" +
				"are still covered in blood, yet I don't have any wounds. My body looked just as\n" +
				"always until I noticed the glass globe in my left arm, marking a spot I was\n" +
				"hit by Infernal. That's... at this point I wasn't even surprised.\n" +
				"I started thinking what could that mean and how could I use it...\n\n" +
				"While thinking I noticed another small glass globe on the floor near me.\n" +
				"I guess those are remains of Infernal Golems. I reached out to pick it up, but\n" +
				"it got absorbed into my hand and small purple orb appeared inside my own globe.\n\n\n" +
